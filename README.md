# Deprecation notice

Since every search engine use case and data set is different, we recommend building your front-end from scratch rather than using this repo. Please check the front-end in the [meme search engine repo](https://github.com/alexcg1/jina-meme-search) as a reference implementation.

streamlit-jina lets you search text or images in your Streamlit app, using [Jina's neural search framework](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/).

## Installation

streamlit-jina is distributed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-jina/):

```python
pip install streamlit-jina
```

## Examples

Using streamlit-jina is as simple as setting an endpoint and what type of thing you want to search for:

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_jina import jina
```

And then choose your search type and plug in your endpoint:

### Text ([example](https://github.com/jina-ai/streamlit-jina/blob/main/examples/jina_text.py))

```python
jina.text_search(endpoint="http://0.0.0.0:45678/api/search")
```
